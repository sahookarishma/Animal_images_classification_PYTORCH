# üê±üê∂ Cat vs Dog Image Classification using PyTorch

This repository demonstrates a complete deep learning pipeline using PyTorch to classify images of cats and dogs. It covers everything from loading data, building the CNN architecture, training, evaluating the model, and performing inference.

## üß† Project Overview

The main goal is to create a binary classifier that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The model is built using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and trained on a labeled dataset.

**Key Steps Covered:**

- Data loading and augmentation
- CNN model definition using PyTorch
- Training loop with real-time metrics
- Validation and testing
- Saving and loading models
- Inference on custom images
